# Instruction
1- _**#include<iostream>**_: for the input/output.\
2- _**using std::cout**_: to prevent typing _std::_ each time we want to display something.\
3- _**using std::cin**_ : to prevent typing _std::_ each time we want to get anything from user.\
4- _**using std::endl**_: to prevent typing _std::_ each time we want to add a new line in the output.\
5- Each C++ program must have at least a main function with the format :\
```
int main()
{
    
        //commands
    
        return 0;
}
```
6- Display the text in the output by using _**cout**_ <<(extraction operator)\
7- Declaration of the integer variable _**number**_.\
8- Get an integer from the user and replace it by the value of the _**number**_ by using **_cin_** and **>>** (_insertion operator_)\
9- Display the _number_ with a text and insert a new line by _**endl**_.\
10- **_return 0_**, if the program works correctly.\
