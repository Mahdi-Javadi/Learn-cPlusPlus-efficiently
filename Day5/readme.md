An array is a set of variables that all of them has the same type,e.g. integer, string etc.

In C++ arrays are defined as the following:

* data-type array-name [array-length] = {initialaztion}
* _Example: int my_array [5] {10,20,30,40,50}_


We declared an array with the:
* name: my_array
* type: integer
* size: 5 elements
* initialized with {10,20,30,40,50}

Accessing elements of an array:

we can access the elements of arrays with [index] 

All the steps are shown in the example.
