# Instruction

Conditional statements comes to play when we want to make the program capable of making decisions under certain conditions. 

## If

The __if__ staement executes the code block, if the condition is fulfilled and otherwise, the compiler just ignores it. Here is the syntax:

```
if (condition) {
    statements
}
```
### Relational Operators
Relational operators help us to evaluate the condition we are looking for. Here are the commonly used realational operators: 
- <=: Smaller or equal to 
    ```
    a <= b 
    ```
    - **a** is smaller equal than **b**
- >=
- ==
- !=
__Note__: It is not necessary to use _indentation_, but it makes the code much more easier to read and follow the conditions. **Always use the indentation for a better code**.
