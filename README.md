# Learn C++ Efficiently
I am intending to publish an easy way for those who wants to learn C++ practically. No jargons and complications!. Each day, one step forward!


Before start, let's have an **overview of the whole journey**:


* There is a readme file in each folders that highlights the important features of the given code.


* For each topic a link is provided in the readme file, for those who wants to gain in-depth knowledge in that topic.


This journey is started with the _Hello World_ project, which basically just display a text in the output.


We will continue with the data types and variable declerations and write a program that get an input from the user and display it.


Here is a ten-day scope :

* [Day1](https://github.com/Mahdi-Javadi/Learn-cPlusPlus-efficiently/tree/master/Day1): Hello world!
* [Day2](https://github.com/Mahdi-Javadi/Learn-cPlusPlus-efficiently/tree/master/Day2): Display something on screen/get something from user
* [Day3](https://github.com/Mahdi-Javadi/Learn-cPlusPlus-efficiently/tree/master/Day3): Comments and variables
* [Day4](https://github.com/Mahdi-Javadi/Learn-cPlusPlus-efficiently/tree/master/Day4): Basic arithmetics
* [Day5](https://github.com/Mahdi-Javadi/Learn-cPlusPlus-efficiently/tree/master/Day5): Conditional statements
* [Day6](https://github.com/Mahdi-Javadi/Learn-cPlusPlus-efficiently/tree/master/Day6): Loops
* [Day7](https://github.com/Mahdi-Javadi/Learn-cPlusPlus-efficiently/tree/master/Day7): Common datatypes
* [Day8](https://github.com/Mahdi-Javadi/Learn-cPlusPlus-efficiently/tree/master/Day8): Function
* [Day9](https://github.com/Mahdi-Javadi/Learn-cPlusPlus-efficiently/tree/master/Day9): Pointers
* [Day10](https://github.com/Mahdi-Javadi/Learn-cPlusPlus-efficiently/tree/master/Day10): Playnig with all the things we have learned
