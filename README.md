# Learn C++ Efficiently
I am intending to publish an easy way for those who wants to learn C++ practically. No jargons and complications!. Each day, one step forward!


Before start, let's have an **overview of the whole journey**:


* There is a readme file in each folders that highlights the important features of the given code.


* For each topic a link is provided in the readme file, for those who wants to gain in-depth knowledge in that topic.


This journey is started with the _Hello World_ project, which basically just display a text in the output.


We will continue with the data types and variable declerations and write a program that get an input from the user and display it.
