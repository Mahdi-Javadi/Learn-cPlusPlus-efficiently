# Learn C++ Efficiently
I am intending to publish an easy way for those who wants to learn C++ practically. No jargons and complications!. Each day, one step forward!


Before start, let's have an **overview of the whole journey**:


* There is a readme file in each folders that highlights the important features of the given code.


* For each topic a link is provided in the readme file, for those who wants to gain in-depth knowledge in that topic.


This journey is started with the _Hello World_ project, which basically just display a text in the output.


We will continue with the data types and variable declerations and write a program that get an input from the user and display it.


Here is a ten-day scope :

* Day1: Hello world!
* Day2: display something on screen/get something from user
* Day3: Comments and variables
* Day4: Basic arithmetics
* Day5: Conditional statements
* Day6: Loops
* Day7: Common datatypes
* Day8: function
* Day9: pointers
* Day10: playnig with all the things we have learned
