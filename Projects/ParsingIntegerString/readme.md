#instruction

In this project we are going to get a string of integeres separated by `,` from the user and put them in a vector. Finally display the elements of the vector. 

## Solution
This can be easily done by using `stringstream` with the header file `sstream`. 

We change the input string to a stringstream and then separate them by their delimiters.
