This is the first project in C++. All you need to know :\n
In order to take advantage of input/out put >> #include <iostream>
std::cout >> allows you to display the results(on the termianl for exmaple)
std::endl >> allows you to jump to a new line when you display the results
The commands in C++ must have ; at the end;
Each program at least has a main() function. If it works correctly, it returns integer 0.
In this program, we display "Hello World!" on the output. Then we go to the next line.
